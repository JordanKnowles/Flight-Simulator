Forecasting the Training Hours at Mach 1
Forecast the demand hours for pilot training at Mach 1 Training Solutions.  We want to anticipate the resources needed to properly train all pilots.  This will help anticipate organizational growth and ensure that resources are allocated properly

2. Be specific on your forecast. Point, Range, Short, Medium, Long,
**ANS: Determine the flight simulator and instructor hours for the months and quarters for 2019 and 2020.  We want to see if the model is appropriate for forecasting the demand of instruction.  We are utilizing multiple regression analysis to see if there are any independent variables that influence the demand for flight training.

3. How will your measure the accuracy of the forecast
**Ans: We will measure the accuracy of the forecasts using various metrics such as MSE, MAPE, and RMSE.  We will analyze the residuals of our model to ensure that we are capturing all meaningful factors in the analysis.

4. Your data set. It should have a time component, a column on what you are forecasting at a minimum. You can have more columns as well.

5. Describe your data, where you got it, how you got it, is there a way others can do the same.
**ANS:  This is historical data from a pilot training companyâ€™s instructor and simulator utilization.  Information is maintained for internal use and employees of the business can obtain the same information through their enterprise analytics dashboard.
